# Aivariantcertificate
During my internship at AI Variant, I gained substantial knowledge and hands-on experience in data analytics, focusing on several core modules such as Excel, Power BI, Tableau, SQL, Python, basics of Python, and basics of R. I mastered advanced functionalities in Excel for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. I created interactive and dynamic dashboards in Power BI and Tableau to visualize data insights and enhance decision-making. My SQL skills were honed through developing and optimizing queries for efficient data retrieval and reporting accuracy. I explored Python for data analysis, utilizing libraries like Pandas and NumPy. Additionally, I learned the fundamental concepts of Python and R programming, focusing on statistical analysis and data visualization. Some of the key projects I completed included architecting an end-to-end data pipeline for Adventure Works Cycles using Python and SQL, which improved reporting efficiency and accuracy, and conducting a comprehensive analysis of Zomato user data, where I built scalable data pipelines and implemented streaming data processing solutions for real-time business analysis. Throughout my internship, I enhanced my technical skills and gained valuable experience in real-world data analytics applications, preparing me to contribute effectively to data-driven decision-making processes.
